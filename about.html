## About

I'm a tech enthusiast that focuses in information security and all things web development. However, I'm never afraid to try something new. Currently, I enjoy experimenting with RoR, Android, Java, and Linux; but I'm volatile and will jump to anything that interests me.

    Some things that I've done in the past include a lot of network security, virtualization, and even Minecraft server hosting.
